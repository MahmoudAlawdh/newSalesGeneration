in this method i generated the month to month seasonality for weekday/weekend store/delivery sales

- in the last file i send there was an issue with seasonality
  am generating the following seasonalities:
- location_type
- industry
- area
- product focus

i added them together and applied it on the sales, the issue is they overlap and i needed to divied by the number of seasonalities applied,
